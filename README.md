# Zeriousify

Zeriousify is a Node.js module for ensuring that your package adheres to the Zerious
Module Standard (ZMS).

ZMS-compliant modules have:
 * 100% test coverage
 * Consistent code style
 * An API
 * A valid package.json
 * .gitignore and .npmignore
 * The MIT license
 * A README.md with badges

These are simple requirements, and Zeriousify includes tools for testing them. For
some of these requirements, Zeriousify can automagically change your package to make
it ZMS-compliant.
